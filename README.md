# CS598-CNN-DDI
This repository attempts to reproduce *[CNN-DDI: a learning-based method for predicting drugâ€“drug interactions using convolution neural networks](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-022-04612-2)*.

Before running any jupyter notebook, do `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

The dataset has been included in the repository. To run training, you do not need to download anything, just run each cell in [training.ipynb](training.ipynb).

You can find all checkpoints we trained [here](https://huggingface.co/conrevo/CS598-CNN-DDI/tree/main).
